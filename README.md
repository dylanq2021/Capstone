# Dylan Quirk's Capstone Project
## My final project for my Senior year at Champlain College.
The of_tutorial.py can be used for testing purposes using a physical switch. The file is made in python POX and requires a python library to be setup on the OS.

The topology.py is created for Mininet emulator but can be used as a baseline enivronment.

Loadbalancer.py is a work in progress, but is designed to allow for network traffic to be more distributed and tracked.
